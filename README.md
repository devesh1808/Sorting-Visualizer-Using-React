# Sorting Visualizer

## It is a Web Application which represents the visualization of  various sorting algorithms
## Algorithms to Visualize
:white_check_mark:  Bubble Sort<br><br>
:white_check_mark:  Insertion Sort<br><br>
:white_check_mark:  Selection Sort<br><br>
:white_check_mark:  QuickSort <br><br>
:white_check_mark:  Merge Sort<br><br>

## Features Added
                                                        
-	Option for choosing Sorting Algorithm for the Visualization
      
-	Slider for controlling the speed of Visualization
                                                    
-	Slider to change the size of array (elements of an array are represented by bars and their values with height of bars)
                                                     
-	A generate button to get random array at any time
                                                                  
-	Start button to start the visualization process and to show dynamic representation of sorting algorithm
                                                             
-	Details about the currently selected sorting algorithm (Definition and Time Complexity) at the footer section

## Project Representation

- Default Interface showing Blue Bars as Elements of the Array and controlling their size can be done by 'Array Size' slider at the top,
  we have algorithm selection , visualization speed , generate and start options at the header.

- Now, selecting the type of algorithm you want to visualize and adjusting the size of array and visualization speed of your own, the 
  visualization process will get started

- And also, at the footer, we do have a section where we will have details about the currently selected sorting algorithm, 
  (let's say quick sort), including the definition and best, average and worst time complexities
